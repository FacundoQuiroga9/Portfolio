    "section":"My journey",
    "text":"I began my journey as a self-learner, immersed in the world of web development, where I acquired essential skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My desire to grow and expand my knowledge led me to take a significant step in my career by joining Le Wagon, where I participated in a programming bootcamp. Here, my focus shifted towards the backend, and I immersed myself in the Ruby language and its powerful framework, Ruby on Rails. It was an enriching experience that allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the logic behind web applications and led me to develop my first full-stack project in a group with other peers, a culmination of my frontend and backend skills. My future vision is to integrate these two worlds of web development, leveraging the best of both to create innovative and comprehensive solutions. I am motivated by the idea of creating applications that are not only visually appealing but also robust in their architecture and functionality. At every step of this journey, I have embraced the challenge of learning and growing in the field of programming."
